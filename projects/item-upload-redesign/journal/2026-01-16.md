## What decision did you make today?
Decided to use image recognition to auto-suggest categories based on the uploaded photo. Will integrate with existing ML pipeline.

## Why did you make this decision?
Rather than making sellers manually browse through 200+ categories, we can analyze their product photo and suggest the top 3 most likely categories. This reduces cognitive load and speeds up the flow.

## What constraints did you consider?
- ML model accuracy needs to be >85% to avoid frustrating users with bad suggestions
- Latency must be under 2 seconds for the suggestion to feel instant
- Need fallback for when image recognition fails
