Created new prototype to better incorporate ai tools. 

Why V2 Uses On-Demand AI Instead of Pre-Computed
Hypothesis: Pre-computed suggestions create a "review then edit" mental model, while on-demand assistance feels more like collaboration.

Faster time-to-form - No loading screen between flow selection and form
Contextual relevance - AI considers what user has already entered
User agency - Seller controls when AI helps, not the other way around
Iterative refinement - Description variations allow multiple AI passes
