## What did you iterate on today?
First prototype of the smart category picker. Tested with 3 internal users.

## What feedback did you receive?
- Users loved that categories appeared automatically
- Confusion when the suggested category was wrong - they didn't realize they could change it
- Request to show confidence level so users know when to double-check

## What will you change?
Adding a subtle "Not quite right? Pick another" link below the suggestions, and showing confidence as a percentage badge.
