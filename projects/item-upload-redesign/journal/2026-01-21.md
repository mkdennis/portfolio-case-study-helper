## What decision did you make today?
Removed any instance of "AI" in suggestions

## Why did you make this decision?
Seller interviews showed that some sellers are hesitant and suspicious using AI tools

## What tradeoff came up?
How do we introduce this new tool more seamlessly instead of introducing a brand new scary tool?
