## What did you learn today?
Conducted 5 user interviews with sellers who frequently upload items. Key finding: 73% of sellers abandon uploads when they can't find the right category within 30 seconds.

## Why is this important?
This validates our hypothesis that category selection is the biggest friction point in the upload flow. Sellers are time-constrained and expect the system to be smarter about suggesting categories.
