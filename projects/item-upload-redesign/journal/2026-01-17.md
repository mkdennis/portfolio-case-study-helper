## What did you work on today?
Created low-fidelity wireframes exploring 3 different UI patterns for presenting category suggestions:

1. **Dropdown with suggestions at top** - Familiar pattern, but suggestions get lost
2. **Pill chips above the dropdown** - More visible, but takes up vertical space
3. **Inline cards with confidence scores** - Most informative, but might be overwhelming

## Why explore multiple options?
Each pattern has tradeoffs between visibility, space efficiency, and information density. Need to test with users to see which feels most intuitive.
